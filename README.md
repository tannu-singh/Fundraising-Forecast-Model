### Fundraising-Forecast-Model

Developed a model to predict whether a donor will donate next month, next quarter, or next year. The dataset which I used was collected over last 13 years and I derived features from the dataset. 

The features extracted from raw data were:
- Average donation
- Frequency of donation
- Avg difference of donation
- Time since first donation
- Time since last donation

With these features I implemented keras model to predict whether a donor will donate next month, quarter, or year. This model gave the accuracy of 92.7% when the data was balanced.
